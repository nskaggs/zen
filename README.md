# zen

> Review PRs and ship features in parallel — each one in its own Claude-ready worktree.

You're reviewing more PRs and starting more features than ever, because [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) makes each one faster. But your IDE and your shell still want one branch at a time. Zen fixes that mismatch.

For every PR in your review queue and every feature you're working on, zen creates a dedicated git worktree with Claude pre-armed: PR context injected as `CLAUDE.local.md` (never touching the repo's own `CLAUDE.md`), the right slash command installed, terminal tab opened on demand. A background daemon watches GitHub, prepares review worktrees silently as PRs come in, fast-forwards them when the PR head moves, and removes them a few days after merge. Open a tab when you're ready — everything is already set up.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mgreau/zen.git && cd zen
flox activate                     # Go 1.25, git, gh, make — or install those yourself
make build && mv zen ~/bin/       # or anywhere on your PATH

gh auth login
zen setup                          # interactive: repos, authors, daemon settings
zen watch start                    # background daemon polls GitHub for PRs
zen inbox                          # see what needs your attention
```

- Alternatively, skip `mv zen ~/bin` and [install with Nix](#install-with-nix).

When a PR shows up in your inbox, `zen review <number>` opens that PR in a new terminal tab with Claude pre-armed and the PR context loaded. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) for what to install first.

## What needs your attention?

`zen inbox` is your daily triage. Three classes of PRs land here:

- **Reviews waiting on you** — PRs from configured authors, plus any explicit review requests.
- **Your own approved-but-unmerged PRs** — signed off, ready to land.
- **Open PRs touching paths you watch** — for staying aware of areas you care about.

```bash
zen inbox                       # everything, filtered by configured authors
zen inbox --all                 # from all authors
zen inbox --path pkg/sts        # PRs touching specific paths
zen inbox --repo other-repo     # different repo
zen inbox --ignore-drafts       # skip drafts on this run (or set ignore_drafts: true in config)
```

Drafts are shown by default. To skip drafts permanently, set `ignore_drafts: true` in your config — see [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md). The `--ignore-drafts` flag overrides the config for a single run.

Example output:

```
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Legend  W = Worktree
       * = local worktree exists
       zen review resume <number> to open  |  zen review <number> to create

## Review a PR

`zen review 42` fetches the PR branch, creates a worktree, injects `CLAUDE.local.md`, installs the `/review-pr` slash command, and opens a terminal tab with Claude. When `--repo` is omitted, zen auto-detects by querying GitHub — if the PR number exists in multiple configured repos, it prefers the one where you're a requested reviewer or asks you to choose.

```bash
zen review 42                    # create worktree + open terminal tab
zen review 42 --repo other       # specify repo explicitly
zen review 42 --no-terminal      # create worktree only, print command
zen review 42 --model opus       # pick model (agent-specific, e.g. opus or gpt-5-codex)
zen review 42 --agent codex      # use Codex for this review (overrides config)
zen review resume 42             # open existing worktree in new terminal tab
zen review resume 42 --list      # list available sessions
zen review resume 42 --session 2 # resume specific session
zen review delete 42             # remove a PR review worktree (with confirmation)
```

If the worktree already exists, zen catches it up to the current PR head and then resumes. It will not merge over local edits or a live agent. If the author force-pushed, you are asked before the checkout is reset. `zen review resume` offers to create the worktree if it is missing.

## Work on a feature

Same isolation model, your own branches. `zen work new` and `zen work resume` open the worktree in a new terminal tab by default; pass `--no-terminal` to skip.

```bash
zen work                                       # list feature worktrees
zen work new <repo> <branch>                   # create new feature worktree
zen work new app my-feature "initial prompt"   # with Claude prompt
zen work new app my-feature --model opus       # pick Claude model
zen work resume <name>                         # resume a feature session in new tab
zen work resume <name> --model opus            # resume with a specific model
zen work delete <name>                         # delete worktree (cleans Claude sessions too)
```

Feature branches are prefixed by `branch_prefix` from config — see [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

Every delete and cleanup path retains worktrees with local changes or a running
agent. The delete commands' `--force` flag skips confirmation; it does not
override those safety checks.

## Where am I?

Different lenses on what you're doing across worktrees.

### `zen who-am-i` — your work summary

```bash
zen who-am-i                         # all repos, last 7 days
zen who-am-i -r app -p 30d           # specific repo, last 30 days
zen who-am-i --merged                # only merged & deployed PRs with descriptions
zen who-am-i --merged -r app -p 7d   # merged PRs in app, last 7 days
```

Three sections: **Merged & Deployed**, **In Progress**, **PR Reviews**. Period formats: `1d`, `7d`, `30d`, `2w`, `1m`. Also exposed via MCP as `zen_who_am_i`.

### `zen status` — overview of all active work

```bash
zen status                       # alias: zen dashboard
```

Worktree counts, PR reviews (with remote state and cleanup ETA), feature work, and daemon state.

### `zen board` — live PR board

```bash
zen board                        # interactive, auto-refreshes every 30s
```

Two live tables:

- **My Pull Requests** — grouped by status (ready to merge, failing CI, changes requested, in review, in flight, draft). PRs stacked on one of your other open PRs (same repo, base branch = another PR's head branch) are shown together with a `|----` marker instead of being scattered by status.
- **Needs Your Review** — across all configured repos, unlike `zen inbox` not filtered by the `authors` config, so nothing slips through. Sorted into three tiers: PRs from someone in your `authors` config, then PRs touching a `watch_paths` entry, then everyone else — newest first within each tier.

Keys: `tab` switches tables, `enter`/`o` opens the selected PR in your browser, `v` starts/resumes a review for the selected row (same as `zen review <number>`), `s` shows/hides the first 20 lines of the selected PR's description (fetched on demand), `r` refreshes now, `q` quits.

### `zen reviews` — your recent reviews

```bash
zen reviews                      # PR reviews from past 7 days
zen reviews --days 30            # past 30 days
```

### `zen search` — find a worktree

```bash
zen search 42                    # by PR number
zen search oidc                  # by branch/name
zen search --type pr <term>      # filter: pr, feature
```

### `zen agent status` — Claude sessions

```bash
zen agent status                 # all worktrees
zen agent status --running       # only running sessions
zen agent status --full          # full token usage scan (slower)
```

Session ID, model, token usage, and last activity per worktree.

## How it works

```
  GitHub ──── zen watch ──── Worktrees Ready ──── You Review ──────── Cleanup
   PRs         (daemon)       (silent prep)       (zen review resume)  (automatic)
```

Two loops keep zen useful.

The **automated loop** is the daemon. It polls GitHub and notifies you of new review requests. Worktrees for `authors:` are created silently, with context already injected, and existing review checkouts fast-forward when the PR head moves. Local edits and live agents are left alone; a force-push waits for `zen review`, which asks before resetting. After a successful catch-up you get a quieter “PR #N updated”. Merged worktrees are removed a few days later. The daemon never opens terminal tabs.

The **manual loop** is yours: check what needs your attention, open a worktree in a new tab with Claude, do the work.

```bash
zen watch start                  # start background daemon
zen watch stop                   # stop daemon
zen watch status                 # show daemon status + last check
zen watch logs                   # tail daemon log output
zen watch logs search 42         # search logs for a PR, worktree, or keyword
```

### Slack task watcher (opt-in)

React to a Slack message with `:claudecode:` (or whatever emoji you configure) and the daemon picks it up: acks in-thread, creates a feature worktree seeded with the discussion as the initial prompt, and opens it in a terminal tab right away — unlike the PR-review flow, which only prepares worktrees silently. When that session goes idle, you get a Slack DM back with a resume command and a link to the thread. Off by default; see [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#slack-task-watcher) for setup (a Slack token with a handful of scopes, via `ZEN_SLACK_TOKEN`).

Manual cleanup, in case you want it (the daemon handles merged PRs automatically, 5+ days after merge):

```bash
zen cleanup                      # find stale worktrees
zen cleanup --days 14            # custom age threshold
zen cleanup --delete             # interactive deletion
```

Daemon internals are in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md). After installing a new zen, restart `zen watch` so the new binary is what polls GitHub — existing worktrees are not rebuilt. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#upgrading).

## Configuration

Minimal `~/.zen/config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  app:
    full_name: octo-sts/app
    base_path: ~/git/repo-octo-sts-app

authors:
  - mattmoor
  - wlynch
```

`zen setup` walks you through this interactively. The daemon hot-reloads config on every poll tick — no restart needed.

### Claude or Codex

By default zen drives [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Set `agent: codex` in config (or pass `--agent codex` to `zen review`/`zen work`) to use OpenAI's [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) instead. zen adapts the launch/resume commands, the injected context file (`CLAUDE.local.md` vs `AGENTS.md`), where slash-command prompts are installed, and how it discovers sessions and token usage. See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#agent).

#### Switch agents mid-task (session migration)

Started a review with one agent and want to continue with the other? Resume with the other agent and zen offers to carry the session over:

```bash
zen review resume 42 --agent codex     # started with Claude? zen offers to migrate
zen work resume my-feature --agent claude --migrate   # skip the prompt
```

When the selected agent has no session for the worktree but the other agent does, zen migrates the most recent one and resumes it:

- **Claude → Codex** uses Codex's own importer (driven over `codex app-server`), so the thread is a first-class Codex session. Already-imported sessions are detected via Codex's import ledger and resumed directly. Codex only detects recent sessions (last 30 days, ~50 most recent).
- **Codex → Claude** translates the rollout into a Claude session file: text and shell commands carry over (shell calls become `Bash` tool history, other tools become annotated text); Codex's encrypted reasoning cannot be migrated. The session opens with a note that it was migrated.

Both directions are lossy where the agents' formats don't overlap — treat the migrated session as carried-over context, not a bit-perfect transcript. Full mechanics in [docs/session-migration.md](docs/session-migration.md).

Full reference (poll intervals, terminal selection, branch prefix, multi-repo disambiguation, state file paths) in [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md).

## MCP server

```
zen mcp serve
```

Speaks Model Context Protocol over stdio so a running Claude session can call zen tools directly: list worktrees, check inbox, fetch PR details, open reviews. Register once:

```
claude mcp add --scope user zen -- zen mcp serve
```

Tool inventory and usage in [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md).

## Context injection

The daemon writes a `CLAUDE.local.md` file into each PR worktree with the PR title, author, changed files, and review instructions. The repo's own `CLAUDE.md` is never touched — there's no risk of accidental commits. When the PR head moves, the daemon (and `zen review` on an existing directory) rewrite that context automatically. `zen context inject` remains the manual escape hatch:

```
zen context inject <path> --pr 42 --repo app
```

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| **macOS or Linux** | On macOS, iTerm2/Ghostty/Terminal.app tab management and notifications use AppleScript; on Linux, use kitty for tabs and `notify-send` (libnotify) for notifications |
| **Git** | Worktree creation, fetching PR branches, cleanup |
| **[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`)** | Authentication and GitHub API access — must be logged in (`gh auth login`) |
| **[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)**, **[Ghostty](https://ghostty.io/)**, **[kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)**, or **Terminal.app** | Opens review/work sessions in new tabs (iTerm2/Ghostty/Terminal.app) or OS windows (kitty). Set `terminal: macos` for the built-in macOS Terminal. Ghostty and Terminal.app need accessibility permissions for tab creation and fall back to new windows otherwise (see [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md#terminal)) |
| **[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`claude`) or [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) (`codex`)** | AI-assisted PR reviews and coding sessions — pick one with `agent:` in config (see [Configuration](#configuration)) |
| **Go 1.25+** | Building from source — or `flox activate` for a pinned toolchain (see [Building](#building)) |
| **[Flox](https://flox.dev)** (optional) | Reproducible local env: `flox activate` then `make build`, or `flox build zen` for a hermetic binary |

## Building

```
flox activate    # optional: pinned Go 1.25.7, git, gh, make
make build
```

`flox build zen` is the same Nix expression the flake uses, built against the Flox catalog (`./result-zen/bin/zen`). It does not put `zen` on PATH; that is still `mv zen ~/bin` or [Install with Nix](#install-with-nix).

### Install with Nix

For people who already use [Nix](https://nixos.org): a flake in this repo builds `zen` for Linux and macOS (`packages.default`, with `git`/`gh` wrapped in). This is an alternative to `mv zen ~/bin`, not a required dependency. `zen setup` still writes `~/.zen/config.yaml`.

**NixOS or nix-darwin** (`environment.systemPackages`):

```nix
# flake.nix
inputs.zen.url = "github:mgreau/zen";

# configuration.nix / darwin/packages.nix
environment.systemPackages = [
  inputs.zen.packages.${pkgs.system}.default
];
```

**home-manager:** `home.packages = [ inputs.zen.packages.${pkgs.system}.default ];`

**Any Nix install:**

```bash
nix profile install github:mgreau/zen
# or one-off: nix run github:mgreau/zen -- version
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for testing and architecture pointers.

## Why "zen"?

I was watching *The Last Dance* when naming this tool. Phil Jackson — the "Zen Master" — and his coaching philosophy resonated: orchestrate the system, trust the players, stay calm while everything moves around you. That's what this tool does: silently prepares worktrees, injects context, cleans up after itself, and lets you focus on the actual review when you're ready.
